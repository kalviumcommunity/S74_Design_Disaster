# **Design Disasters - Where Great Ideas Went Wrong**

### **Project Overview**:
This project is a lighthearted platform that showcases funny and disastrous logo and design fails. Users can view a random fail, upvote or downvote it based on how hilarious or cringe-worthy it is. The goal is to create a simple yet interactive site that allows users to engage with the content through voting, while demonstrating key technical skills in frontend and backend development.

### **Key Features**:
- **Random Fail**: A button that displays a random design fail every time it's clicked.
- **Voting System**: Users can upvote or downvote each design fail based on how funny or awful it is.
- **Top Voted Fail**: A section that shows the fail with the highest votes (upvoted) based on user interactions.

### **Tech Stack**:
- **Frontend**: React, Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB

### **Why This Project**:
I chose this project because it's simple, fun, and focuses on core features that allow me to demonstrate essential skills in web development. The project:
- Allows me to work with backend APIs, a database (MongoDB), and integrate them with the frontend.
- Implements an interactive voting system, showcasing real-time user engagement.
- Focuses on user authentication (optional) and basic data management (upvotes, downvotes).

This project is interesting because it's engaging and easy to interact with, while also helping me practice key development concepts like user interaction, database management, and frontend/backend integration.
